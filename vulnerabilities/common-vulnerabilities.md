# Common Vulnerabilities

## What are Vulnerabilities?
Vulnerabilities are weaknesses in a system, application, or network that can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access, cause damage, or disrupt operations.

## Common Types of Vulnerabilities
- **SQL Injection**: Allows attackers to manipulate SQL queries to execute arbitrary commands on the database.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
- **Buffer Overflow**: Occurs when more data is written to a buffer than it can hold, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
