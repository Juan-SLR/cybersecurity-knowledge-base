# Incident Response Overview

## What is Incident Response?
Incident response refers to the process of identifying, managing, and mitigating security incidents. The goal is to manage the incident, minimize damage, and restore normal operations as quickly as possible.

## Key Steps in Incident Response
1. **Preparation**: Creating incident response plans, tools, and resources.
2. **Detection**: Identifying potential security incidents through monitoring.
3. **Containment**: Isolating affected systems to prevent further damage.
4. **Eradication**: Removing the cause of the incident.
5. **Recovery**: Restoring systems and services.
6. **Lessons Learned**: Reviewing the incident to improve response for the future.
