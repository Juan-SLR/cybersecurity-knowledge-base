# SQL Injection: Understanding and Preventing It

## Description
SQL Injection (SQLi) is a vulnerability that allows attackers to interfere with the queries your application makes to its database. It can lead to unauthorized access and data exposure.

## Key Concepts
- **Input Validation**: Ensure all user inputs are sanitized.
- **Prepared Statements**: Use parameterized queries instead of dynamically constructing SQL queries.

## Mitigation
- Always validate user inputs.
- Use prepared statements for database queries.
- Enable least privilege access for database accounts.
